# Initial Business Request

This document contains the original, unrefined business request as received. It is preserved verbatim to demonstrate the starting point of this project.

## Original Request (Verbatim)

We need a booking system. Users should be able to book something, cancel, and admins should see everything. It needs to be simple. We might need payments later, but not now. It should avoid double-bookings.

---

## Analysis

The original request is characteristic of early-stage business requirements:

- **Vague scope**: "book something" doesn't specify what can be booked
- **Undefined roles**: "users" and "admins" mentioned without clear permission boundaries
- **Implicit requirements**: "avoid double-bookings" implies concurrency handling
- **Future considerations**: payments mentioned but explicitly deferred
- **Ambiguous quality attributes**: "simple" is subjective

This ambiguity is normal and expected in real-world projects. The next step is to clarify these requirements through structured analysis, documented in [clarified-requirements.md](./clarified-requirements.md).
